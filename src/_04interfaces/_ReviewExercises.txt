R9.2 superclass and subclass

There probably won't be many shared attributes or methods/verbs that can be defined in the SmallAppliance superclass. The
use would be in defining these things in one place.

R9.4 SavingsAccount

R9.10 Casting

One is an object cast and one is a primitive cast. In the former, the cast will succeed even if the object is null and will
compile even if the cast is a downcast that wouldn't work (and then a class cast exception is thrown at runtime).
In the case of casting to an int, this will only succeed if not null, but a downcast will always work (even though it's
not a great idea because of what it could do to intended values).

b/ true
c/ false
d/ true
e/ true
f/ false
